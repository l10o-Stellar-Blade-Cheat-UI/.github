## 🧩 What Is the Cheat UI?

The **Cheat UI** is a modded overlay or trainer-based panel that injects a **custom menu** into your gameplay screen. Think dev console meets next-gen UI – neatly organized with categories like Combat, Skins, Resources, Visuals, and more.

With a single key (like `F1`, `Insert`, or your custom binding), you pop open the panel and toggle everything **live**, without restarting or breaking your flow.
